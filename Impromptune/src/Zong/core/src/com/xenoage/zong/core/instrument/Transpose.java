 * Transposition of an instrument.
 * 
 * Like in MusicXML (following documentation copied), a transposition
 * contains the following data:
 * 
 * The transposition is represented by chromatic steps
 * (required) and three optional elements: diatonic pitch
 * steps, octave changes, and doubling an octave down. The
 * chromatic and octave-change elements are numeric values
 * added to the encoded pitch data to create the sounding
 * pitch. The diatonic element is also numeric and allows
 * for correct spelling of enharmonic transpositions.
